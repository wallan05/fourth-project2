    <h1>History of Karachi</h1>
    <p>
      The area of Karachi (Urdu: کراچی, Sindhi: ڪراچي) in Sindh, Pakistan has a
      natural harbor and has been used as fishing port by local fisherman
      belonging to Sindhi tribes since prehistory. &nbsp;<br />
      Archaeological excavations have uncovered a period going back to IndusS
      valley civilisation which shows the importance of the port since the
      Bronze Age.<br />
      The port city of Banbhore was established before the Christian era which
      served as an important trade hub in the region, the port was recorded by
      various names by the Greeks such as Krokola, Morontobara port, and
      Barbarikon, a sea port of the Indo-Greek Bactrian kingdom and Ramya
      according to some Greek texts.<br />[1] The Arabs knew it as the port of
      Debal, from where Muhammad bin Qasim led his conquering force into Sindh
      (the western corner of South Asia) in AD 712. Lahari Bandar or Lari Bandar
      succeeded Debal as a major port of the Indus; it was located close to
      Banbhore, in modern Karachi. The first modern port city near Manora Island
      (now Manora Peninsula) was established during British colonial Raj in the
      late 19th century.

    <h2>Pre history</h2>
    <p>
      The Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites found by Karachi University team
      on the Mulri Hills, in front of Karachi University Campus, constitute one
      of the most important archaeological discoveries made in Sindh during the
      last fifty &nbsp; &nbsp; & &nbsp; years. <br />
      The last hunter-gatherers, who left abundant traces of their passage,
      repeatedly inhabited the Hills. Some twenty different spots of flint tools
      were discovered during the surface surveys.
